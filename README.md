## 📌 Description for submission

The main source code is in: `CODE/Lab_1/Core/Src/main.c`


All code parts of each exercise are grouped in the `main.c` file.  

Each exercise is written as a separate function, and related exercises can use each other’s functions.

## 🔌 Pin connection

- **Ex1**: 2 pins for 2 LEDs (Switch State)
- **Ex2**: +1 pin → total: 3 pins (1-way traffic light)  
- **Ex3**: +3 pins → total: 6 pins (4-way traffic light)  
- **Ex4**: +7 pins → total: 13 pins (7-segment)  
- **Ex5**: total: 13 pins (add a 7-segment LED into a 4-way traffic light)  
- **Ex6**: total: 13 pins (reusable)  
- **Ex7, Ex8, Ex9**: functions (`clear()`, `clear(int index)`, `set(int index)`)  
- **Ex10**: no extra pins needed

## 📝 Note
All the code is grouped into the `main.c` file.  

All simulations in Proteus use STM32 with the same source, so it is easier to manage the code.  

When you need to simulate any exercise, just remove the corresponding comment.
