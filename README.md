Description for submission: 
main.c included in "CODE" file which in source "CODE/Lab_1/Core/Src/main.c"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All code parts of each exercise are grouped in the main.c file
Each exercise is written as a separate function, related exercises can use each other's functions
The pin connection is described like this:
Ex1: 2 pins for 2 leds (Switch State)
Ex2: 1 more pin, total: 3 pins (1waytrafficlight)
Ex3: 3 more pins, total: 6 pins (4waytrafficlight)
Ex4: 7 more pins, total: 13 pins (7segment)
Ex5: total: 13 pins (add a 7segment LED into a way of 4waytrafficlight)
Ex6: total: 13 pins (reusable)
Ex7, Ex8, Ex9 (clear(), clear(int index), set(int index) function)
Ex10: No need more pin
That's the reason why I group all the code into the main.c file, all simulations in Proteus have
STM23 using the same source, so it will be easier to manage the code, when you need to simulate any 
exercise, just remove the corresponding comment.
